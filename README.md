####Step one:

 - Install rocksdb 
 - The supported version is 4.5

####Step two:

 1. Go to source folder
 2. Run  'go test -v'

*Note: It's tested on Ubuntu so far.*

###Features of this implementation:

 1. It's based totally on the C++ head files of rocksdb. So, it potentially can support all the features of rocksdb.
 2. There is a C wrapper between the go and C++ rocksdb. Some logics can be freely added on this layer.
 3. Everything is pure golang on the go layer including callbacks and garbage collection of DB related objects. 
 4. Lots of DB related objects can be closed manually or garbage collected.
 5. It supports most of features already and can be easily extended with the current code struct.

Most importantly - Enjoy it!
