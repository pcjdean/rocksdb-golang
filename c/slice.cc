// Slice is a simple structure containing a pointer into some external
// storage and a size.  The user of a Slice must ensure that the slice
// is not used after the corresponding external storage has been
// deallocated.
//
// Multiple threads can invoke const methods on a Slice without
// external synchronization, but if any of the threads may call a
// non-const method, all threads accessing the same Slice must use
// external synchronization.
