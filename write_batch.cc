// WriteBatch holds a collection of updates to apply atomically to a DB.
//
// The updates are applied in the order in which they are added
// to the WriteBatch.  For example, the value of "key" will be "v3"
// after the following batch is written:
//
//    batch.Put("key", "v1");
//    batch.Delete("key");
//    batch.Put("key", "v2");
//    batch.Put("key", "v3");
//
// Multiple threads can invoke const methods on a WriteBatch without
// external synchronization, but if any of the threads may call a
// non-const method, all threads accessing the same WriteBatch must use
// external synchronization.
