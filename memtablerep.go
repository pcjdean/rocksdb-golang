// This file contains the interface that must be implemented by any collection
// to be used as the backing store for a MemTable. Such a collection must
// satisfy the following properties:
//  (1) It does not store duplicate items.
//  (2) It uses MemTableRep::KeyComparator to compare items for iteration and
//     equality.
//  (3) It can be accessed concurrently by multiple readers and can support
//     during reads. However, it needn't support multiple concurrent writes.
//  (4) Items are never deleted.
// The liberal use of assertions is encouraged to enforce (1).
//
// The factory will be passed an MemTableAllocator object when a new MemTableRep
// is requested.
//
// Users can implement their own memtable representations. We include three
// types built in:
//  - SkipListRep: This is the default; it is backed by a skip list.
//  - HashSkipListRep: The memtable rep that is best used for keys that are
//  structured like "prefix:suffix" where iteration within a prefix is
//  common and iteration across different prefixes is rare. It is backed by
//  a hash map where each bucket is a skip list.
//  - VectorRep: This is backed by an unordered std::vector. On iteration, the
// vector is sorted. It is intelligent about sorting; once the MarkReadOnly()
// has been called, the vector will only be sorted once. It is optimized for
// random-write-heavy workloads.
//
// The last four implementations are designed for situations in which
// iteration over the entire collection is rare since doing so requires all the
// keys to be copied into a sorted data structure.
